# Comparison between Azure VM and Azure App Service

 

When considering deploying applications on Azure, you have several options, including Azure Virtual Machines (VM) and Azure App Service. Each option has its advantages and trade-offs. In this comparison, we will analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow for both services to help you make an informed decision.

 

## Azure Virtual Machines (VM)

 

### Analyze Costs:

- VMs offer more flexibility in terms of configuration, allowing you to choose the exact hardware specifications, operating system, and software.

- Costs can vary depending on the VM size and the number of VMs you deploy.

- VMs require you to pay for reserved compute resources, even if your application is not running.

 

### Scalability:

- Vertical scaling (increasing VM size) can be done to handle increased load, but this may require downtime during the resizing process.

- Horizontal scaling (adding more VM instances) is possible, but it requires manual setup and configuration.

 

### Availability:

- VMs can be set up in availability sets or availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance.

- VMs allow you to configure custom load balancing and network configurations.

 

### Workflow:

- VMs require more management and maintenance tasks, such as patching, updates, and monitoring.

- You can install custom software and configure the VM to suit your application's specific needs.

- VMs are suitable for applications with complex configurations and dependencies.

 

## Azure App Service

 

### Analyze Costs:

- App Service offers a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, meaning you don't need to worry about underlying infrastructure management.

- Costs are based on the plan you choose (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, etc.) and the resources you need, such as CPU, memory, and storage.

- You only pay for the resources you consume, and the scaling model can help you optimize costs based on demand.

 

### Scalability:

- App Service allows auto-scaling based on predefined metrics, such as CPU usage, or on a schedule. This helps your application handle varying workloads efficiently.

- Scaling is done automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention and allowing for seamless growth.

 

### Availability:

- App Service automatically load balances incoming traffic across multiple instances, improving availability and performance.

- It provides built-in disaster recovery and backup options, ensuring high availability of your application.

 

### Workflow:

- App Service simplifies the deployment process, supporting various deployment options like Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, FTP, or Docker containers.

- You don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure, and the platform handles OS updates and patches.

- App Service is ideal for web applications and APIs that do not require complex configurations or custom software installations.

 

# Assess app changes that would change your decision.

 

- Azure App Service is the ideal choice for deployment due to its easy deployment from Git or GitHub, automatic scaling, cost-effectiveness, and managed environment. It offers high availability through load balancing, integrates with DevOps tools, and supports multiple languages. With staging environments and built-in monitoring, it ensures efficient and hassle-free application deployment and management.
